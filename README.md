🌬 The Silent Wind - Wind is invisible, yet always present. Sometimes it lashes out as a storm; other times, it wraps around us as a gentle breeze.

💡Purpose

Wind is the invisible, but it clearly touches our bodies. To enable us to feel the invisible, this project uses light and motion as alternative expressions.
